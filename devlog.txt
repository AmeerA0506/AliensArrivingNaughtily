OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to use Scanners in order to extract inputs from separate files. We populated an arrayList with inputs directly from another file (without using the "<" command in the terminal).
We had to break in order to exit the scanner while guessing for characters.
ANSI styling only needs to be applied once and it will stay for all strings printed out until it gets changed or reset.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to add the ability to guess an entire phrase at once.
Add Timer!
Add Two Player?

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ameer's brother is a pretty good programmer!
the switch() statement is a good alternative to a chain of else if statement.
char primitives store the ASCII values of the symbol they contain.
There are ways to customize the terminal (with the resources in TerminallyIll)
You can clear the terminal using java code by printing out "\033[2J"
