Pull before you push
Measure thrice cut once
SUMMON THE DUCKIE!
Grow your code incrementally
Never stray far from compilable code
Implement MVP ASAP
Think SIMPLE, Think SMART
Utilize KtS liberally
A rising tide lifts all boats
Oh you smell that? Smells like a QAF post to me
Get in where you fit in
Clap Clap-Clap-Clap-Clap Clap-Claaaap
Keys to success become keys to failure in relaxation days
refrain from using the intertrash
You're missing out on opportunities to engage with fellow meatbags
If you people keep saying linear search for insertion sort im going to jump out the window. It's cold out there
Can you turn on the dark please?
Can you exterminate the hallway dwellers, or shut the door please?
