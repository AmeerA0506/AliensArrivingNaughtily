## What is this Project?
In order to showcase what we have learned during this semester, we felt that a game of Hangman would be a good way to show what we learned.


a mix of Array iteration, input/output usage, as well as comparisons between lists, strings, and characters. A random phrase is picked out of a list picked by the user. After that, the user guesses a letter, in which all instances of that letter are then revealed. if there are no instances of the letter, a hangman diagram gains a part, and if the body gets completed the game finishes. You can also choose to guess a phrase.

## How to Launch?

1. git clone `git@github.com:AmeerA0506/AliensArrivingNaughtily.git`

2. `cd` into the directory

3. enter `javac Woo.java`

4. enter `java Woo`

5. Let the instructions inside of the game guide you!

## How does it work?
1. You are only allowed to either guess one character at a time or the entire phrase itself. If you input more than one character while trying to guess a single character, we will just use the first character in your input.
2. You are not allowed to guess one character more than once. If you try to do so, we will catch you slippin' and make you guess again.
3. After six incorrect guesses, the game will end.
4. You will see the amount of time you spent on the game at the end of the program.
