## Dont Hang Da Man :: Nakib Abedin, Ameer Alnasser, Alif Rahman

## What is this Project?
* In order to showcase what we have learned during this semester, we felt that a game of Hangman would show a mix of Array iteration, input/output usage, as well as comparisons between lists, strings, and characters. A random phrase is picked out of a list picked by the user. After that, the user guesses a letter, in which all instances of that letter are then revealed. if there are no instances of the letter, a hangman diagram gains a part, and if the body gets completed the game finishes. You can also choose to guess a phrase/

## How to launch?

* clone the github repo, then type javac Woo.java, then java Woo. There should be a launching screen, which is then followed by a list of 6 categories after any user input. Depending on the category inputted by the user, the game would pick a different word.
